  **About Regulate Florida**

  The mission of Regulate Florida is to create a practical and enforceable framework for adult use of marijuana.

  Through a program of regulation and education, we will limit access to minors, prevent abuse and curtail driving while impaired. We will enable the creation of jobs and allow consenting and informed adults to choose to use cannabis responsibly rather than be labeled as criminals. while reducing the use of limited law enforcement resources.
