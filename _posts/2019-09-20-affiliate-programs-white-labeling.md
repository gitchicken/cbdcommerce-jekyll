title: Affiliates / White Labeling
subtitle: "We've received many questions regarding various CBD programs being offered
  on the net and for good reason. Simply put, the majority of the CBD on the market
  is being sold and distributed that way. In fact, if you Google and skim through
  most of the top ranked sites, you will see these programs being offered by nearly
  everyone. There is indeed a lot of competition but there's also plenty of profit
  to be made. So, what are the differences and which may be right for you.\n\n**Affiliate
  Programs** \n\nFor those who don't know what an affiliate is, there are basically
  banner ads and codes you ad to your web site. When a user clicks on an affiliate
  link it gets tracked and cookie'd. If a sale is made from that request, you get
  a commission. It's a tried and true way to make money on the net with minimal effort.\n\n**Wholesale
  Partners / Drop Shipping**\n\nThese programs are the net level up form an affiliate.
  What is great is that you get to control how much money you make from a sale. What's
  \ more, there little to no over required. No need for inventory or having to deal
  with shipping. You can spend more of your time and money on marketing. Then sit
  back and reap the rewards from the sales. \n\n**White Labeling**\n\nSo, you want
  to Brand your own CBD .. Maybe just to sell online or get you product on the shelf?
  - Then White Labeling is for you!\n\nWhite Labeling is not a new concept. For those
  unfamiliar with the term, White Labeling is the rebranding of a product or service
  produced by one company to appear as if it's unique for another. More likely than
  not, you purchase white label products every day and don't even know it. Admittedly,
  as America consumers we have are favorites and we even  you pay more (or less) our
  \"our brand\" think it's better than another but nope, they're the same thing. \n\nAs
  mentioned, the CBD market right now is saturated with white labeled brands and at
  multiple levels. Meaning one particular grower or co-op is marketed under many different
  names. The trick is to get the best rates, closest to the top of the pyramid, of
  a particular grower or co-op.\n\nWhite Labelling will cost you more to get started
  but in the end you will have a branded product to market to your hearts content. "
