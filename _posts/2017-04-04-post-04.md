### What Are Merchant Services?

If you're new to eCommerce there's a good chance you haven't had to to set up a merchant account or payment gateway before. Maybe you've sold items eBay, Etsy, Shopify or even Amazon. Unfortunately, if you want to sell a CBD product, those options just aren't available at the moment. 

### PayPal, Stripe & Shopify

For many online businesses these are great options. However, non of them at the moment allow transactions for CBD products.

Sure you can try but know this, if they catch you they will not only close your account, they may also seize your money.

Trust me when I tell you, for a few extra bucks, getting a high risk merchant account is the far better then try to get your money released.

### High Risk Merchant Accounts

Don't let the terminology fool you, there's really is nothing wrong with a "high risk" merchant account. Especially if you are in a business deemed "high risk" such as CBD. Yes, it may cost a little more to set up. Yes, there may be higher fees charged per transaction.
